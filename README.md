# Learn-MongoDB

## Brief Description of the repository

    Environment:
        - MongoDB 6.0 Windows
        - Mongosh
    Github: https://github.com/RemainAplomb

    This repository will contain my files for learning MongoDB

## Installation

## MongoDB

To get started, install MongoDB from this link:

    https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/

Choose the installation that fits your operating system

## Mongosh

After installing MongoDB, you will need Mongosh.
You can download it here:

    https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/install/

If you downloaded the zip file, you will need to extract it
to your desired location. In my case, I placed it in documents.

Furthermore, you will need to open the mongosh folder, and go to
bin. There will be an executable file there, copy its file location
in the properties, and add it to the environment variables

After doing that, you can check whether mongosh is being recognized
by the command prompt:

```
mongosh
```
