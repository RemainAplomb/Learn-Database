# Introduction

## Brief Description

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to communicate with and manipulate relational databases. It provides a standardized way to interact with databases, allowing you to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.

## Database

A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed in a structured format. It provides a way to store and retrieve information efficiently. Databases are commonly used in various applications and systems to handle large volumes of data.

## Why do we use database?

Databases offer several advantages over other data storage methods, such as storing data in flat files or spreadsheets. Here are a few reasons why we use databases:

    - Data organization: Databases provide a structured way to organize and store data. It allows you to define tables, columns, relationships, and constraints, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

    - Data retrieval: Databases offer powerful querying capabilities that allow you to retrieve specific data based on various conditions. You can search, sort, and filter data efficiently.

    - Data consistency: With a database, you can enforce rules and constraints on data integrity. It ensures that the data stored in the database is accurate, valid, and consistent.

    - Concurrent access: Databases can handle multiple users accessing and modifying data simultaneously. They provide mechanisms to control concurrent access and maintain data integrity in multi-user environments.

    - Data security: Databases offer security features to protect sensitive data. You can define user roles, permissions, and access controls to ensure data privacy and prevent unauthorized access.

## What are the types of databases?

There are different types of databases, each designed to serve specific requirements. Here are a few common types:

    - Relational databases: Relational databases organize data into tables with predefined relationships between them. They use SQL as the query language. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server.

    - NoSQL databases: NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that provide flexible and scalable data storage. They are suitable for handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.

    - Object-oriented databases: Object-oriented databases store data in the form of objects, similar to object-oriented programming. They are designed to work with object-oriented programming languages and provide better support for complex data structures and relationships.

    - Hierarchical databases: Hierarchical databases organize data in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships. They are mainly used in older systems and specialized applications.

    - Graph databases: Graph databases store data in nodes and edges, representing complex relationships between entities. They are ideal for handling highly connected data, such as social networks, recommendation engines, and network analysis.

These are just a few examples, and there are other types of databases available as well, each with its own strengths and use cases.

## What can we store in a database?

Databases can store a wide range of data types, including:

    - Numeric types: Integers, decimals, floating-point numbers.

    - Character types: Strings, characters, text.

    - Date and time types: Dates, times, timestamps.

    - Boolean types: True or false values.

    - Binary types: Binary data, such as images or files.

    - Other specialized types: Geospatial data, JSON, XML, etc.

The specific data types available may vary depending on the database system you are using.

## How do we store in a database?

To store data in a database, you typically follow these steps:

    - Design the database schema: Define the structure of the database, including tables, columns, relationships, and constraints. This step involves planning and identifying the data entities and their relationships.

    - Create the database and tables: Use SQLcommands to create the database and tables based on the schema design. For example, you can use the CREATE DATABASE statement to create a new database and the CREATE TABLE statement to create tables with the desired columns and data types.

    - Insert data into the tables: Use the INSERT INTO statement to add data into the tables. Specify the table name and the values to be inserted for each column. You can insert data row by row or in bulk using a single INSERT statement.

    - Retrieve data from the database: Use the SELECT statement to query the database and retrieve specific data. You can specify the columns to be returned, conditions to filter the data, and sorting instructions.

    - Update data in the tables: Use the UPDATE statement to modify existing data in the tables. Specify the table name, columns to be updated, and the new values. You can also add conditions to update specific rows based on certain criteria.

    - Delete data from the tables: Use the DELETE FROM statement to remove data from the tables. Specify the table name and conditions to identify the rows to be deleted. Be cautious with this operation as it permanently removes data.

These are the basic steps involved in storing data in a database. As you progress and learn more SQL concepts, you can explore advanced topics like joins, indexes, transactions, and more.

I hope this helps you understand the fundamentals of databases and SQL! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.

# Set up SQL Environment

## SQLite

SQLite DB Browser is a popular graphical user interface (GUI) tool for working with SQLite databases. It provides an intuitive interface for managing SQLite databases, creating tables, executing queries, and viewing data. Here's how you can set up and use SQLite DB Browser:

Download SQLite DB Browser: Visit the official SQLite DB Browser website (https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Ensure that you download the latest stable release.

Install SQLite DB Browser: Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the instructions to install SQLite DB Browser on your computer. The installation process is straightforward and similar to installing any other software.

Launch SQLite DB Browser: After installation, launch SQLite DB Browser from your applications or by double-clicking the desktop icon.

Open an Existing Database or Create a New One: In SQLite DB Browser, you can either open an existing SQLite database file (with a .db or .sqlite extension) or create a new database. To open an existing database, go to "File" > "Open Database" and navigate to the location of the database file. To create a new database, go to "File" > "New Database" and specify a name and location for the new database file.

Explore the Database Structure: Once you have opened a database, you can see the database structure on the left side of the SQLite DB Browser interface. It will show the tables, views, indexes, and other objects in the database.

Create Tables: To create tables in the database, go to the "Execute SQL" tab. Enter the SQL statement to create the table in the text editor, and then click the "Execute" button to execute the query. The table will be created in the database.

Query and Manipulate Data: To execute SQL queries and manipulate data, switch to the "Browse Data" or "Execute SQL" tab. In the "Browse Data" tab, you can view and edit the data in the tables using a spreadsheet-like interface. In the "Execute SQL" tab, you can enter SQL queries directly and execute them to retrieve or modify data.

Save and Backup: SQLite DB Browser automatically saves the changes made to the database. However, it's a good practice to make regular backups of your database files to avoid any data loss.

SQLite DB Browser provides a user-friendly environment for managing SQLite databases, making it easier to work with SQL and interact with your data visually.

Remember to consult the SQLite DB Browser documentation or help resources for more detailed instructions on using the tool effectively.

## SQLite - Create Database

To create a database using SQLite DB Browser, follow these steps:

    - Launch SQLite DB Browser.
    - Go to "File" > "New Database" or click the "New Database" button on the toolbar.
    - Specify the name and location for the new database file. Choose a meaningful name and a location where you want to store the database file on your computer.
    - Click the "Save" button to create the database.
    - SQLite DB Browser will create a new SQLite database file with the specified name and location. The file will have a .db or .sqlite extension. Once the database is created, you can start working with it by creating tables, inserting data, and executing SQL queries.

Remember to save your database file and make regular backups to prevent data loss.

If you already have an existing SQLite database file, you can open it in SQLite DB Browser by going to "File" > "Open Database" and navigating to the location of the database file on your computer.

## SQLite - Constraints

Constraints in SQL are rules or conditions that you can apply to columns or tables to enforce data integrity and maintain data consistency. They define limitations and restrictions on the values that can be inserted, updated, or deleted in a database table. Here are some commonly used constraints:

1. Primary Key Constraint: A primary key constraint uniquely identifies each row in a table. It ensures that the primary key column(s) have unique values and cannot be NULL. To add a primary key constraint, you typically specify it at the time of table creation or alter an existing table.

Example of adding a primary key constraint at table creation:

```
CREATE TABLE table_name (
column1 datatype PRIMARY KEY,
column2 datatype,
...
);
```

Example of adding a primary key constraint to an existing table:

```
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD PRIMARY KEY (column1);
```

2. Foreign Key Constraint: A foreign key constraint establishes a relationship between two tables based on the values of a column. It ensures that the values in the foreign key column(s) of one table correspond to the values in the primary key column(s) of another table. Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity. Foreign keys must reference primary keys or unique keys in the referenced table.

Example of adding a foreign key constraint at table creation:

```
CREATE TABLE orders (
order_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
customer_id INTEGER,
FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);
```

Example of adding a foreign key constraint to an existing table:

```
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_customer
FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id);
```

3. Unique Constraint: A unique constraint ensures that the values in the specified column(s) are unique and cannot be duplicated. It allows NULL values unless specified otherwise.

Example of adding a unique constraint at table creation:

```
CREATE TABLE table_name (
column1 datatype,
column2 datatype,
...
UNIQUE (column1)
);
```

Example of adding a unique constraint to an existing table:

```
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_constraint_name UNIQUE (column1);
```

4. Not Null Constraint: A not null constraint ensures that the values in the specified column(s) cannot be NULL.

Example of adding a not null constraint at table creation:

```
CREATE TABLE table_name (
column1 datatype NOT NULL,
column2 datatype,
...
);
```

Example of adding a not null constraint to an existing table:

```
ALTER TABLE table_name
ALTER COLUMN column1 SET NOT NULL;
```

These are just a few examples of constraints in SQL. Depending on the database system you are using, there may be additional constraints and variations available. Constraints play a vital role in maintaining data integrity and ensuring data consistency within a database.

Remember to consult the documentation or resources specific to your database management system for detailed information on constraints and their usage.

## SQLite - Fields

In SQL, fields are commonly referred to as columns. Columns represent the individual data elements within a table. Each column has a specific data type and can have additional properties or constraints associated with it. Here's how you can work with fields (columns) in SQL:

1. Define Fields (Columns) in Table Creation:
   When creating a table, you define the fields (columns) and their corresponding data types. You can also specify additional properties such as constraints, default values, and more.

Example of creating a table with fields (columns):

```
CREATE TABLE table_name (
column1 datatype constraint,
column2 datatype constraint,
...
);
```

In the above example, table_name is the name of the table, and column1, column2, etc., are the field (column) names. Replace datatype with the appropriate data type for each column.

2. Alter Table to Add, Modify, or Drop Fields (Columns):
   You can use the ALTER TABLE statement to add, modify, or drop fields (columns) in an existing table.

Example of adding a new field (column) to an existing table:

```
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype constraint;
```

Example of modifying the properties of an existing field (column):

```
ALTER TABLE table_name
ALTER COLUMN column_name datatype constraint;
```

Example of dropping a field (column) from an existing table:

```
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;
```

3. Retrieve Data from Specific Fields (Columns):
   To retrieve data from specific fields (columns) in a table, you use the SELECT statement.

Example of retrieving data from specific fields (columns):

```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

In the above example, column1, column2, etc., represent the field (column) names from which you want to retrieve data.

4. Update Data in Specific Fields (Columns):
   To update data in specific fields (columns) in a table, you use the UPDATE statement.

Example of updating data in specific fields (columns):

```
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

In the above example, column1, column2, etc., represent the field (column) names you want to update, and value1, value2, etc., represent the new values.

Remember to adjust the table name, column names, and data types to match your specific use case.

Working with fields (columns) allows you to define the structure of your table, retrieve specific data, and modify data as needed within your SQL queries.
