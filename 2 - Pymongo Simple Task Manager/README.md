# Pymongo Simple Task Manager

## Installation

### MongoDB

To get started, install MongoDB from this link:

    https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/

Choose the installation that fits your operating system

### Mongosh

After installing MongoDB, you will need Mongosh.
You can download it here:

    https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/install/

If you downloaded the zip file, you will need to extract it
to your desired location. In my case, I placed it in documents.

Furthermore, you will need to open the mongosh folder, and go to
bin. There will be an executable file there, copy its file location
in the properties, and add it to the environment variables

After doing that, you can check whether mongosh is being recognized
by the command prompt:

    mongosh

### Pymongo
Before installing Pymongo, ensure that you have Python installed 
on your system. Pymongo is compatible with Python 3.x versions. 
If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from 
the official Python website:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/

To install Pymongo, you need to use pip, which is the package 
installer for Python. Pip is usually installed along with 
Python, so you should have it available in your command 
prompt or terminal.

Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following 
command to install pymongo:

    pip install pymongo

This command will fetch the latest version of the Pymongo 
package from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and install 
it on your system.
